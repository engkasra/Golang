# 🐹 Go Playground & Projects

Welcome to my personal Go (Golang) development space. This repository is a collection of my learning progress, experiments, and mini-projects in Go. I'm using this to explore best practices, language features, and real-world development workflows — all version-controlled and open to the world.

## 📁 Structure

| Folder / File      | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `cmd/`             | CLI tools or applications built with Go. |
| `pkg/`             | Shared packages and utilities. |
| `internal/`        | Internal packages (not meant for public use). |
| `go.mod / go.sum`  | Go module files for dependency management. |
| `test/`            | Unit tests, benchmarks, and testing tools. |

---

## ✅ Goals

- Learn and practice core Go concepts: structs, interfaces, concurrency, etc.
- Build small CLI tools or APIs.
- Use best practices in Go code structure and module management.
- Push all work (from scratch to deploy) into this single repository for transparency and growth tracking.

## 🚀 Projects / Mini-Tools

| Project | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `hope-printer` | A simple console app that prints "Hope" at intervals or patterns. | ✅ Complete |
| `todo-api` | REST API with Go + Gorilla Mux | 🛠 In progress |
| `cli-timezone` | A CLI tool to convert time zones | 🔜 Planned |

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- [Go (Golang)](https://golang.org/)
- Standard Library (`fmt`, `bufio`, `strconv`, etc.)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- (Optional) [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) for routing
- (Optional) Go Modules for dependency management

## 💡 Why This Repo?

This repository is part of my **journey to master Go**. Every folder, file, and commit tells a story — from beginner experiments to more complex, real-world tools and services.  
It's also a showcase for potential collaborators, employers, or contributors.
